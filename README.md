## 🚀 Overview  
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on airline-related tweets using **machine learning algorithms**. The goal is to classify tweets into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiments to understand customer feedback and airline performance.  

## 📌 Features  
✔ **Data Preprocessing** – Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization  
✔ **Feature Extraction** – TF-IDF, Sentiment Scores  
✔ **Machine Learning Models** – Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest  
✔ **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
✔ **Visualization** – Bar Charts, Word Clouds, Logistic Regression Curve  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains airline tweets labeled as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**. It includes text-based customer reviews and complaints regarding airline services.  

## 🛠 Installation

   ```

## 📊 Model Performance  

| Model            | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 85% | 82% | 83% | 83% |
| Naive Bayes        | 82% | 79% | 80% | 80% |
| Random Forest      | 88% | 85% | 86% | 86% |

## 📈 Visualizations  
🔹 **Sentiment Distribution** – Pie chart representation  
🔹 **Word Cloud** – Most common words in each sentiment category  
🔹 **Logistic Regression Curve** – Probability distribution of positive sentiment  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
✅ Implement **Deep Learning models** (LSTMs, BERT)  
✅ Incorporate **real-time Twitter streaming** for live sentiment analysis  
✅ Expand dataset for better generalization
